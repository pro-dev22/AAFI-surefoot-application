<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Open your browser's Developer Tools Console </li>
  <li>Copy the provided code snippet</li>
  <li>Paste it into the Console and press Enter</li>
   <li>Observe changes on the product page</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Variation A: Confidence Booster Message</strong></h2>
Target URL: All product pages https://www.oxo.com/oxo-professional-5pc-starter-set.html

<br/><br/>
<b>Approach Explanation:</b><br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li><b>Targeted Insertion:</b> I identified the .pdp-promotional-block-wrapper as the anchor point to insert the message. Placing the new span before this block ensures it appears above the promotional content without disrupting the existing layout.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Smooth Appearance:</b> To avoid abrupt visual changes, I used CSS opacity with a transition for a subtle fade-in effect. The setTimeout ensures this triggers after a tiny delay, allowing the DOM to render the element first.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Unobtrusive Styling:</b> The message is styled to be subtle (small, gray, italic) so it complements the page rather than competing with primary content. The centered 50% width keeps it readable without overwhelming the space.</li><br/>
  <span>This approach prioritizes seamless integration while maintaining the page's existing structure and user experience.</span>
</ol>
<br/><br/>


<h2><strong>Variation B: The Easter Egg Surprise</strong></h2>
Target URL: All product pages https://www.oxo.com/oxo-pop-20-piece-pop-container-set.html


<br/><br/><span><strong>ðŸ”´ Note:</strong> The GIF image fails to load because your website's Content Security Policy (CSP) restricts which domains can load images. The current policy does not allow the domain hosting the GIF, causing the browser to block it for security reasons. All other functionality is working correctly - we've confirmed the GIF displays properly when targeting product pages on other websites, and all features are functioning as required.</span>

<br/><br/>
<b>Approach Explanation for GIF Easter Egg:</b><br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li><b>Trigger Mechanism:</b>The GIF is revealed after 5 hovers on the "Add to Cart" button, creating a fun, unexpected interaction. This ensures it doesnâ€™t distract users immediately but rewards engagement.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Smooth Animation & Dismissal:</b> The GIF appears with a fade-in + slide-up animation (using opacity and transform) for a polished feel.It can be dismissed by clicking the GIF or adding to cart, ensuring it doesnâ€™t linger unnecessarily.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Unobtrusive Styling:</b> The GIF is centered, width-constrained, and shadowed for visual appeal without breaking layout.A subtle hover scale effect adds interactivity, while max-height: 0 hides it cleanly when inactive.</li><br/>
  <span>This approach balances playfulness with usabilityâ€”delighting users without disrupting core functionality.</span>
</ol>
<br/><br/>




<h2><strong>Variation C: Recommended Products</strong></h2>
Target URL: Exactly https://www.oxo.com/oxo-good-grips-12-piece-smart-seal-glass-container-set.html
<br/><br/>
<b>Approach Explanation for Product Recommendations Section</b><br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li><b>Insertion Point:</b> The section is dynamically added before the .m-product__ugc element, ensuring it appears in a logical, high-visibility location without disrupting existing content.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Grid System:</b> Uses a responsive 3-column grid (shifting to 2-column on tablets, 1-column on mobile) to showcase products cleanly while adapting to screen sizes.</li><br/>
    <li><b>Visual Hierarchy:</b> The bold "You Might Also Like" heading (left-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile) immediately communicates the section's purpose.</li><br/>
    <li><b>API Integration:</b> Fetches only 3 recommendations via Algolia to minimize load time.</li>
</ol>
